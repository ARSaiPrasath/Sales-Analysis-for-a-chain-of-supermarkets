# Sales-Analysis-for-a-chain-of-supermarkets-using-R
Understanding the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales
Dataset description :  This dataset contains sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities in a csv file format. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined.

In this project, the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales are understood. I am analyzing this data using R to gain insights from different products across different stores to observe trends. I have performed missing value treatment and feature engineering to make the data ready for prediction. I performed label encoding to categorically separate size and location. I have presented the analysis with the help of visualizations.
